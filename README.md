# ShiftySwitches

This library provides easy control over **SN74HC595** shift resistor with using [`Shifty`](https://github.com/johnnyb/Shifty) as core. It is designed to control individual IO pins by assigning unique id. Specially made to control relay switches.

## Dependency

This library has dependency of `Shifty`. you must first resolve that by installing `Shifty` library in you Arduino IDE. ([library](https://github.com/johnnyb/Shifty))

## Examples

The library comes with a number of example sketches. See File > Examples > ShiftySwitches
within the Arduino application.

## Usage

- TODO (Check examples for now)

## Limitations

- It has all the limitation of `Shifty`. [library](https://github.com/johnnyb/Shifty/issues)

## Compatible Hardware

The library is only tested on ESP32 wifi boards. It may work on ESP8266 as well.
